      <p>Explaining 9 types of API testing. Next week's topic will be listed at the end.</p>

<p>ðŸ”¹ Smoke Testing</p>
<p>This is done after API development is complete. Simply validate if the APIs are working and nothing breaks.</p>

ðŸ”¹ Functional Testing
This creates a test plan based on the functional requirements and compares the results with the expected results.

ðŸ”¹ Integration Testing
This test combines several API calls to perform end-to-end tests. The intra-service communications and data transmissions are tested.

ðŸ”¹ Regression Testing
This test ensures that bug fixes or new features shouldnâ€™t break the existing behaviors of APIs.

ðŸ”¹ Load Testing
This tests applicationsâ€™ performance by simulating different loads. Then we can calculate the capacity of the application.

ðŸ”¹ Stress Testing
We deliberately create high loads to the APIs and test if the APIs are able to function normally.

ðŸ”¹ Security Testing
This tests the APIs against all possible external threats.

ðŸ”¹ UI Testing
This tests the UI interactions with the APIs to make sure the data can be displayed properly.

ðŸ”¹ Fuzz Testing
This injects invalid or unexpected input data into the API and tries to crash the API. In this way, it identifies the API vulnerabilities.
